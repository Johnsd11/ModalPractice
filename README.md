# ModalPractice

Created a webpage with 3 buttons that open modals and close modals using eventhandling. 
This project is just to practice refracting repetitive code like opening and closing the modal in different ways.
I open each model with a button click, while I close each modal with either an esc click, x btn, or clicking on the outside overlay.
